- system: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
- compiler: clang 3.4
- NVidia CUDA 7.0
- NVidia Optix 3.8.0
- AntTweakBar lib

- write a cmake-find-file(or use ours) to include the lib 
and call it in the CmakeLists.txt from the OptixSDK (or use ours), 
you will find cmake files in the folder "other cmake files"
- assets: we used several obj files, if you want to use your own ones: just import them
in blender and export them as a .obj file (alter the export settings, e.g. normals)

- use the programm3.cpp to change the default scene that should be loaded
- have a look at the display.cpp to see the keyboard settings that we've made
- you can assign different .obj files in the display.cpp in the keyboard settings(F5)
- we wrote our own scene-files to load whole scenes, it's .ssf (SoproSceneFile)

known bugs:
- AshikhminShirley material produces black artifacts on the borders
- Windows Resoultion < 1080p: interface is shifted -> maximize and rescale the window
- Application 'crashes' if you close the window (actually the programm is closed, so doesn't matter)
- Glas material produces small artifacts (not at all)
- framerate dumps if you change material attributes in the GUI
- we know that the doxygen docu isn't complete ;)
